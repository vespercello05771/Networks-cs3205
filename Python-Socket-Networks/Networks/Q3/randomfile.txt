Once upon a time, there was a young prince who lived in a magnificent castle surrounded by vast, lush gardens. Despite his privileged life, the prince was unhappy, for he felt that something was missing from his life. One day, he decided to set out on a journey to find true happiness.

He traveled far and wide, meeting people from all walks of life and experiencing many different cultures. Despite all of the new and exciting things he encountered, the prince still felt unfulfilled. Just when he was about to give up on his quest, he stumbled upon an old sage who lived in a small cottage at the foot of a mountain.
