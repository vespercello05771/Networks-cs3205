The sage listened to the prince's tale of woe and offered him some sage advice. "True happiness cannot be found by searching for it," the sage said. "Instead, it is found within. You must learn to be content with who you are and what you have, and then happiness will come to you naturally."

The prince took the sage's words to heart and made a decision to return home and begin his journey towards inner peace. Over time, as he learned to be grateful for what he had and to appreciate each day as a blessing, he found that happiness did indeed come to him naturally.

And so, the prince lived happily ever after, content in the knowledge that true happiness was within him all along.
